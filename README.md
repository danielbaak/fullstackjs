# Sails RequireJS Backbone example

This example application uses 
 * [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) for server side APIs,
 * [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) for
[AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition) and
dependency management, and 
 * [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) for client side
routing and View-Model functionality.

It is meant to demonstrate a simple architecture which allows for multiple
[SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
modules that are managed by sails server side routes and internally use
Backbone's routing mechanisms.
